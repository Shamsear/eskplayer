## Data Storage

### matches.csv Structure
```csv
MatchID,Date,Club,Player,Role,Goals,GoalsConceded,CleanSheet,Points
1,2024-01-15 14:30:00,CHELSEA,Sanju,Captain,2,1,0,3
1,2024-01-15 14:30:00,CHELSEA,Mufaris,Member,1,0,1,3
1,2024-01-15 14:30:00,INTER MILAN,Fajas,Captain,1,2,0,0
1,2024-01-15 14:30:00,INTER MILAN,Melwin,Member,0,1,0,0
```

### Calculations
- **Goals**: Directly entered by user
- **Goals Conceded**: Goals scored by direct opponent (Captain vs Captain, Member vs Member)
- **Clean Sheet**: 1 if direct opponent scored 0 goals, otherwise 0
- **Points**: 3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss (individual matchup basis)

## Example Workflow

### 1. Enter a Match: Chelsea vs Inter Milan
- **Captain vs Captain**: Sanju (2 goals) vs Fajas (1 goal)
- **Member vs Member**: Mufaris (1 goal) vs Melwin (0 goals)

### 2. Automatic Processing
- **Captain matchup**: Sanju wins (3 points), Fajas loses (0 points)
- **Member matchup**: Mufaris wins (3 points), Melwin loses (0 points)
- **Clean sheets**: Mufaris gets clean sheet (Melwin scored 0), others don't
- **Team totals**: Chelsea 6 points, Inter Milan 0 points
- Data saved with Match ID 1

### 3. View Results
- **Golden Boot**: Sanju (2 goals), Mufaris (1 goal), Fajas (1 goal)
- **Golden Glove**: Melwin (1.0 avg conceded), Fajas (2.0 avg), Sanju/Mufaris (varies)
- **Clean Sheets**: Mufaris (1 clean sheet)
- **Team Standings**: Chelsea (6 points), Inter Milan (0 points)

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design
- **Storage**: CSV file (easily viewable in Excel/Google Sheets)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use:**
   - Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

2. **Module not found:**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **CSV file locked:**
   - Close Excel if you have `matches.csv` open

### Development Mode
The app runs in debug mode by default, which means:
- Automatic restart on code changes
- Detailed error messages
- Hot reloading

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Match history view
