FINAL FAIR RATING SYSTEM PROPOSAL
FIFA-Style Time Decay + Match Confidence
================================================================================

DATE: October 12, 2025
SYSTEM: Hybrid FIFA-Style with Confidence Factor


================================================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

Current Issues:
1. Player with 2 matches can rank #1 (unfair to veterans)
2. Player with 40 matches but inactive for 6 months stays #1 (unfair to active)
3. Division 6 players with many wins outrank Division 1 players
4. New players get inflated ratings from lucky streaks


================================================================================
SOLUTION: TWO-FACTOR RATING SYSTEM
================================================================================

Factor 1: FIFA-STYLE TIME DECAY
- Recent matches matter more
- Old matches count less
- Forces players to stay active

Factor 2: MATCH CONFIDENCE
- Need enough matches to prove skill
- Minimum 20 weighted matches for full confidence
- Prevents lucky streaks from inflating rating


================================================================================
COMPLETE FORMULA
================================================================================

Step 1: Calculate Time-Weighted Base Rating (FIFA-style)
-----------------------------------------------------------
For each match in last 90 days:
  - If 0-30 days old:   Weight = 1.0  (100% - FULL)
  - If 31-60 days old:  Weight = 0.5  (50% - HALF)
  - If 61-90 days old:  Weight = 0.25 (25% - QUARTER)
  - If 90+ days old:    Weight = 0.0  (0% - NOT COUNTED)

Total Weighted Points = Sum of (Match Rating × Time Weight)
Total Weight = Sum of all weights
Base Rating = Total Weighted Points / Total Weight


Step 2: Apply Match Confidence Factor
--------------------------------------
Match Confidence = min(Total Weight / 20, 1.0)

Meaning:
  - 0-5 weighted matches:   0-25% confidence
  - 5-10 weighted matches:  25-50% confidence
  - 10-15 weighted matches: 50-75% confidence
  - 15-20 weighted matches: 75-100% confidence
  - 20+ weighted matches:   100% confidence (FULL TRUST)


Step 3: Calculate Final Rating
-------------------------------
Final Rating = 300 + (Base Rating - 300) × Match Confidence


================================================================================
REAL EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Active Player with Many Matches (IDEAL)
---------------------------------------------------
Player: Rashid
Last 30 days:  15 matches (×1.0) = 15 weighted matches
31-60 days:    8 matches (×0.5) = 4 weighted matches
61-90 days:    0 matches
TOTAL WEIGHTED: 19 matches
AVERAGE RATING: 410

CALCULATION:
Step 1: Base Rating = 410 (time-weighted average)
Step 2: Match Confidence = 19/20 = 0.95 (95%)
Step 3: Final Rating = 300 + (410 - 300) × 0.95
                     = 300 + (110 × 0.95)
                     = 300 + 104.5
                     = 405

RESULT: 405 rating → RANK #1 ✅
STATUS: Active + Proven = Fair #1


EXAMPLE 2: New Player with Few Matches
---------------------------------------
Player: New Player
Last 30 days:  2 matches (×1.0) = 2 weighted matches
31-60 days:    0 matches
TOTAL WEIGHTED: 2 matches
AVERAGE RATING: 380

CALCULATION:
Step 1: Base Rating = 380
Step 2: Match Confidence = 2/20 = 0.10 (10%)
Step 3: Final Rating = 300 + (380 - 300) × 0.10
                     = 300 + (80 × 0.10)
                     = 300 + 8
                     = 308

RESULT: 308 rating → RANK #15 ✅
STATUS: Only 2 matches - Can't be #1 yet (FAIR!)


EXAMPLE 3: Moderate Matches, Good Performance
----------------------------------------------
Player: Siraj
Last 30 days:  5 matches (×1.0) = 5 weighted matches
31-60 days:    8 matches (×0.5) = 4 weighted matches
TOTAL WEIGHTED: 9 matches
AVERAGE RATING: 400

CALCULATION:
Step 1: Base Rating = 400
Step 2: Match Confidence = 9/20 = 0.45 (45%)
Step 3: Final Rating = 300 + (400 - 300) × 0.45
                     = 300 + (100 × 0.45)
                     = 300 + 45
                     = 345

RESULT: 345 rating → RANK #5 ✅
STATUS: Good performance, but needs more matches (FAIR!)


EXAMPLE 4: Many Matches BUT Inactive
-------------------------------------
Player: Ahmed (Former #1)
Last 30 days:  0 matches (×1.0) = 0 weighted matches
31-60 days:    5 matches (×0.5) = 2.5 weighted matches
61-90 days:    20 matches (×0.25) = 5 weighted matches
TOTAL WEIGHTED: 7.5 matches
AVERAGE RATING: 420 (was high, but old)

CALCULATION:
Step 1: Base Rating = 420 (but from old matches)
Step 2: Match Confidence = 7.5/20 = 0.375 (37.5%)
Step 3: Final Rating = 300 + (420 - 300) × 0.375
                     = 300 + (120 × 0.375)
                     = 300 + 45
                     = 345

RESULT: 345 rating → RANK #6 ⚠️
STATUS: DROPPED FROM #1 - Penalty for inactivity (FAIR!)


EXAMPLE 5: Veteran, Fully Proven and Active
--------------------------------------------
Player: Khalid
Last 30 days:  12 matches (×1.0) = 12 weighted matches
31-60 days:    10 matches (×0.5) = 5 weighted matches
61-90 days:    8 matches (×0.25) = 2 weighted matches
TOTAL WEIGHTED: 19 matches
AVERAGE RATING: 395

CALCULATION:
Step 1: Base Rating = 395
Step 2: Match Confidence = 19/20 = 0.95 (95%)
Step 3: Final Rating = 300 + (395 - 300) × 0.95
                     = 300 + (95 × 0.95)
                     = 300 + 90
                     = 390

RESULT: 390 rating → RANK #2 ✅
STATUS: Active + Proven = Fair ranking


EXAMPLE 6: Weekend Player (Casual)
-----------------------------------
Player: Weekend Warrior
Last 30 days:  1 match (×1.0) = 1 weighted match
31-60 days:    1 match (×0.5) = 0.5 weighted matches
TOTAL WEIGHTED: 1.5 matches
AVERAGE RATING: 370

CALCULATION:
Step 1: Base Rating = 370
Step 2: Match Confidence = 1.5/20 = 0.075 (7.5%)
Step 3: Final Rating = 300 + (370 - 300) × 0.075
                     = 300 + (70 × 0.075)
                     = 300 + 5.25
                     = 305

RESULT: 305 rating → RANK #18 ✅
STATUS: Not enough matches to rank high (FAIR!)

================================================================================
WHY THIS SYSTEM IS FAIR
================================================================================

✅ CAN'T GAME WITH FEW MATCHES
Player with 2 matches at 380 average:
  → Only 10% confidence
  → Final rating: 308 (NOT 380!)
  → Can't jump to #1 with lucky wins

✅ CAN'T GAME WITH OLD MATCHES
Player with 20 old matches (61-90 days):
  → Only 25% time weight (×0.25)
  → Only 5 weighted matches
  → Low confidence (5/20 = 25%)
  → Rating heavily penalized

✅ REWARDS ACTIVE + PROVEN PLAYERS
Player with 19 weighted matches, all recent:
  → 95% confidence
  → Full weight for recent matches
  → Rightfully ranks #1

✅ INACTIVE PLAYERS DROP NATURALLY
Former #1 stops playing:
  → After 30 days: Rating drops 25%
  → After 60 days: Rating drops 50%
  → After 90 days: Rating drops 75%
  → Can't stay on top without playing

✅ DIVISION-AWARE
  → Division 1 players start at 400 → Higher match ratings
  → Division 6 players start at 150 → Lower match ratings
  → System naturally prevents low division from outranking high

✅ COMEBACK FRIENDLY
Inactive player returns and plays 10 matches:
  → Gets full weight (×1.0) for new matches
  → Can climb back up with good performance
  → Fair second chance


================================================================================
TIMELINE: FORMER #1 WHO STOPS PLAYING
================================================================================
