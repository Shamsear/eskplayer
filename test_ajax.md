# Testing AJAX Division Management

## What Was Fixed:

### Backend (`app.py`):
1. ✅ Added AJAX detection using `X-Requested-With` header and `Accept` header
2. ✅ `add_division` action now returns JSON when called via AJAX
3. ✅ `delete_division` action now returns JSON when called via AJAX
4. ✅ Both actions still support regular form submission as fallback

### Frontend (`edit_tournament.html`):
1. ✅ Added `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header to both AJAX requests
2. ✅ Added `Accept: application/json` header to both AJAX requests
3. ✅ Form submission prevented with `e.preventDefault()`
4. ✅ Dynamic DOM manipulation functions to add/remove divisions without reload
5. ✅ Success toast notifications
6. ✅ Smooth animations for add/delete operations
7. ✅ Division count updates automatically
8. ✅ Empty state shown when no divisions exist

## How to Test:

1. **Start the Flask app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate to Edit Tournament**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard
   - Click on a tournament
   - Click "Edit Tournament"

3. **Test Adding Division**:
   - Change tournament type to "Division Tournament"
   - Fill in Division Name (e.g., "Premier League")
   - Fill in Starting Rating (e.g., 500)
   - Click "Add Division"
   - **Expected**: No page refresh, division appears instantly with animation, success toast shows

4. **Test Deleting Division**:
   - Click the trash icon on any division card
   - Confirm deletion
   - **Expected**: No page refresh, division fades out and disappears, success toast shows

5. **Test Multiple Operations**:
   - Add 3-4 divisions without page refresh
   - Delete them one by one without page refresh
   - Watch the division count update automatically

## What You Should See:

### Add Division:
- Button shows spinner: "Adding..."
- Form clears after success
- New division card slides in with animation
- Green success toast appears top-right: "Division 'Name' added successfully!"
- Division count updates automatically
- No page refresh!

### Delete Division:
- Delete button shows spinner
- Confirmation dialog appears
- Division card fades out and shrinks
- Card removes after animation
- Green success toast appears: "Division deleted successfully!"
- If last division deleted, empty state appears
- No page refresh!

## Troubleshooting:

If page still refreshes:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try adding a division
4. Check the request:
   - Should show `fetch` or `XHR` type (not `document`)
   - Headers should include `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`
   - Response should be JSON (not HTML)

If you see HTML response instead of JSON:
- Backend is not detecting AJAX request
- Check Flask console for errors
- Verify headers are being sent correctly
