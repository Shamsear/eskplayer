Recalculate All Player Ratings Script

This script recalculates all player ratings and statistics by replaying 
all matches in chronological order using the new enhanced rating system.

The enhanced system includes:
- Base ELO rating changes
- +2 points per goal scored
- -1 point per goal conceded  
- +5 points for clean sheets
- -15 point penalty for nullified matches (both players absent)

SAFETY: This script preserves all match data and only updates calculated values.
